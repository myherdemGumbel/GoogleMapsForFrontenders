# GoogleMapsForFrontenders
This project creates a custom map with custom markers and info windows by reading from a json file. 

Main purpose is to help frontend developers or web designers to use google maps to showcase a list of data without using JS.

What do you need to use it:
1. Update the "your_api_key" with your google api key.
2. update the data in projects.json.
3. update the images folder if you want to use different icons and images.
